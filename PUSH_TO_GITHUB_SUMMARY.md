## What Needs to Be Done

1. **Generate a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)**:
   - Follow the detailed instructions in `GITHUB_PAT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`

2. **Branch Issues**:
   - If the remote repository already has content, you might need to pull first:
     ```bash
     git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories
     ```
   - Resolve any merge conflicts and then push again
